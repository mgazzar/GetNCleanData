# GetNCleanData

Getting and cleaning data project assignment

This project transforms the raw Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from www.smartlab.ws (Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Davide Anguita. November 2012) into a tidy data set.

The source data and code books are available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 




#How to run the script:

1. Download the data from the original source provided in the code book.
2. Set your working directory to the parent folder where the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is now stored.
3. Run "run_analysis". The script should install the data.table package for you.
4. The final versions of "all" and "as_means" will appear in your viewer window.
