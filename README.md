# GetNCleanData

Getting and cleaning data project assignment

This project transforms the raw Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from www.smartlab.ws (Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Davide Anguita. November 2012) into a tidy data set.

The source data and code books are available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

##project purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.




#How to run the script:

1. Download the data from the original source provided in the code book.
2. Set your working directory to the parent folder where the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is now stored.
3. Run "run_analysis". The script should install the data.table package for you.
4. The final versions of "all" and "as_means" will appear in your viewer window.
